# FluentResults

This repository contains my first steps into the world of functional programming and is mainly inspired by the code written by vkhorikov's course, which i have simplefied and extended to fit some personal needs.



 # Disclaimer
 in the scientific literature there is a saying "Standing on the shoulders of giants", meaning that we would never created some of our best work if we hadn't been able to use the work or our predecessors, and continue using these to push the boundaries of what is possible even further.
 
 I will not go as far as stating that this project pushes these boundaries, but the code written here was inspired by techniques, and code that other people wrote. The code in this repo is inspired by the following giants:
  
- vkhorikov's pluralsight course "Applying Functional Principles in C#"
    - the corresponding github: (https://github.com/vkhorikov/CSharpFunctionalExtensions)
